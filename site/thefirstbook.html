<p> The first book is considered to be the ancient "Epic of Gilgamesh," a story about an epic Babylonian king who goes through a series of adventures in the pursuit of immortality. 
  Other very early books from this period include hymns to animalistic deities and other popular stories.
  These books were generally carved on stone or written on papyrus, not in "codex" form like we have today. 
  Humans have been reading for thousands of years at this point, but the advent of written history -  which told about what people generations before had said or did, did not formally exist until the Ancient Greek thinker Herodotus told the story of Greek society (specifically Greco-Persian Wars)
  in his Histories; 
  he is now considered in academic circles to be the father of western historiographical thought. </p>
