  <h1> Influencial Literature </h1>
  
<div> Popular works of literature include: Romeo and Juliet (and other assorted plays) by William Shakespeare, Cantebury Tales by Geoffrey Chaucer, and 1984, by George Orwell. Generally, popular works of literature tend to be novels, works of philosophy, or books of poetry or plays. Some non-fiction books have also become quite famous, but ficticious works of literature have always captured the public imagination. My favorite work of literature is A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, by Betty Smith! It's quite a long read but Smith really immerses you in the world of early 1900's Brooklyn.  </div>
