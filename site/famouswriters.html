<p> The act of writing or publishing literature has brought fame to many over millennia.
  Famous authors include Leo Tolstoy (War and Peace), Charles Dickens (A Tale of Two Cities, David Copperfield), Lewis Carroll (Alice In Wonderland), Chinua Achebe (Things Fall Apart), and Voltaire (Candide).
  Famous writers of the 20th century include Ernest Hemingway and Margaret Atwood. 
  Recently, more emphasis has been placed on highlighting novels written by authors of non-western or european backgrounds, and many courses in foundational literature now focus on African and Asian literature as well.
