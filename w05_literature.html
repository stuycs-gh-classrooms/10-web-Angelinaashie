  <h2> The First Book </h2>
<p> The first book is considered to be the ancient "Epic of Gilgamesh," a story about an epic Babylonian king who goes through a series of adventures in the pursuit of immortality. Other very early books from this period include hymns to animalistic deities and other popular stories. These books were generally carved on stone or written on papyrus, not in "codex" form like we have today. </p>
